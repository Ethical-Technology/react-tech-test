# React tech test

This short test will test your knowledge of React, git and async javascript. It will also assess your communication skills. Spend no more than 60 minutes on it.

Your job is to fix the following issues:

1. Code does not compile

2. Code styling is suboptimal

3. Code does not follow clean code patterns (https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)

4. After compilation issue is fixed, the react app does not show all the superheroes and it constantly shows loading

5. The git history has bad commit messages which don't mean anything

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository + install dependencies

2. Record a screencast as you review the code, debug the problems and fix the issues. You don't need to turn your camera on, just record your screen. Talk through what you're thinking as you review the code so I can understand your process. Refer to https://raygun.com/learn/javascript-debugging-tips for some advanced debugging techniques.

3. Commit your changes

4. Use git rebase to squash the previous commits (excluding yours) and rewrite them with a better message

5. Create a new private repository (don't fork because otherwise other candidates can see your solution)

6. Share access with username jeznag

7. Email the link to your screencast and your repository to jeremy@delugeonaluge.com

## Acceptance Criteria

To pass this test, your submission must:

1. Show all the superheroes and not have a persistent loading message

2. Be in a private repository and only have two commits: one with all of my commits squashed together and reworded with a proper message and the other with your changes

3. Follow the clean code standards explained here: https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript

4. Include a screencast showing you debugging using advanced debugging techniques (not just console.log)
